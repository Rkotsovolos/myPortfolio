    <h2>About Myself</h2>
      <p>Who I am? A unique question for each individual with all unique answers since we are all different in our own ways. To be clear and forward, I am someone who is looking for the next opportunity. The next opportunity to grow as a person and to better my family, to better my career and to better myself. In doing so bettering the company that chooses to accept me into their work force. I am someone up to the challenges to be presented and solved. I am dedicated to the development of increasing my knowledge and furthering myself along with the company I work for while also being a helping hand to fellow peers. I care about people in a way that I don't see very often in this world and hope that I can transpire into more than just a consistant employee and grow with a company who sees these traits as a value.</p>

  <div class="capabilities">

    <p>Even though I am currently in the middle of becoming a software developer and have not been paid to do any coding yet, my capabilities are limited to a spreadsheet, when in reality I can offer more.</p>

    <p>I work tirelessly to learn new concepts to make sure an understanding of what is being asked is what is being answered. I understand basic javascript code, css, and html.</p>
